## 🌟 Overview

**MindCare Elder** is an AI-powered mental health assistant designed to provide **empathetic, supportive, and context-aware conversations** for elderly users experiencing loneliness, anxiety, fear, stress, or memory-related concerns.

The project combines **Retrieval-Augmented Generation (RAG)** with **parameter-efficient LoRA fine-tuning** on **Mistral-7B-Instruct** to improve response quality while maintaining lightweight inference through **4-bit QLoRA quantization**.

Instead of generating responses solely from model memory, the assistant retrieves relevant supportive context from a FAISS vector database before generating responses, improving factual consistency and contextual relevance.

This project demonstrates an end-to-end Generative AI pipeline including data preprocessing, semantic retrieval, model fine-tuning, response generation, and comprehensive evaluation using multiple NLP metrics.

# 🔬 Methodology

The proposed framework integrates Retrieval-Augmented Generation (RAG) with LoRA fine-tuning to generate context-aware and empathetic responses.

1. **Dataset Preparation** – Collect and preprocess public mental health datasets.
2. **Knowledge Base Construction** – Generate embeddings using **SentenceTransformer** and store them in a **FAISS** vector database.
3. **Model Fine-tuning** – Fine-tune **Mistral-7B-Instruct** using **LoRA (PEFT)** with **4-bit QLoRA** quantization.
4. **RAG Pipeline** – Retrieve relevant context from FAISS and combine it with the user query for prompt generation.
5. **Response Generation** – Produce empathetic, context-aware responses using the fine-tuned model.
6. **Performance Evaluation** – Assess the model using **BLEU**, **ROUGE**, **BERTScore**, **Confusion Matrix**, and **Latency Analysis**.

# ⚠️ Limitations

While the proposed framework demonstrates promising performance, it has several limitations:

- Supports only **English-language** interactions.
- Developed and evaluated using **publicly available mental health datasets**.
- Implemented as a **Jupyter Notebook** prototype rather than a production-ready application.
- Responses are intended for **educational and research purposes** and should not replace professional mental health advice.
- Training and fine-tuning require access to GPU resources for optimal performance.

---

# 🚀 Future Work

Several enhancements can further improve the proposed framework:

- 🌍 Multilingual conversational support.
- 🎤 Voice-based interaction for elderly users.
- 🌐 Web application deployment using **Streamlit** or **Gradio**.
- 📱 Mobile application integration.
- 🧠 Long-term conversational memory for personalized interactions.
- 🩺 Integration with domain-specific medical and psychological knowledge bases.
- ☁️ Deployment on cloud platforms for scalable inference.
